***********************
What is Lsd?
***********************

Lsd is based on the assumption that simulation models are distinguihed from simulation programs. Using Lsd a user is concerned exclusively with the description of the theoretical model, while all the technicalities of the program implementing the model are automatically generated in an intuitive and computationally efficient way.

Lsd can be considered as a modelling language. Using Lsd a user is required to describe a model as if it were a system of discrete equations, where each variable is associated to piece of code (usually short and simple), indicating how the generic instance of the variable must compute its value at a generic time step. No other coding is required (e.g. to define the simulation cycle, saving data series, etc.). The required programming skills to use Lsd are therefore solely dependent on the complexity of the equations of the model.

The code for the equations is expressed in a highly symbolic form, using a development environment providing assistance and examples. From this code the system automatically generates a program endowed with a complete set of interfaces to exploit the model. With such interfaces the user can: define the elements of the model, run simulations in various modes, inspect in any details events at run time, being informed on errors, analyse the results, generate automatic documentation.

The user interfaces and the skills required to implement simple models can be learned in a few days of training. Being based on C++ a Lsd model can both express any computational content, and make use of existing libraries, generating extremely fast and efficient code. Lsd is an opensource project and makes use of other opensource tools, as the GNU C++ compiler, Tcl/Tk windowing toolkit, gnuplot graphical package. Lsd is available natively for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X systems, with minimal requirements.

***********************
Lsd installation content
***********************
This distribution contains:
- Lsd source code, for the creation of simulation models
- Several Lsd example models
- Lsd Model Manager (LMM), a developing environment for Lsd models
- Documentation, as context dependent help pages 
- (Windows version only) GNU C++ compiler and other GNU stuff. 

Lsd source code
The Lsd source files are usually managed (e.g. for compilation) automatically, so that users need not to worry for technical issues. Upgrading to new versions of Lsd (which always guarantees backward compatibility) necessitates only to replace the source files.

Lsd example models
Several models contained in the distribution provide examples on the design of a whole models or can be used to copy-and-past single equations or chunks of code.

LMM
Lsd models can be developed using a text editor and pre-defined compilation instructions (i.e. makefile), so that users are allowed to use their preferred coding environment. However, the distribution contains a simple IDE providing all the functionalities required by the (limited) programming needs of a Lsd model project. LMM permits to manage easily several modelling projects, develop Lsd models' code with extensive assistance, exploit debugging tools.
 
Documentation
All the documentation is accessible through the help menus, presented as HTML pages. In particular, there documentation is made of:
- The Lsd manual covers the interfaces for using Lsd model programs.
- The LMM manual concerns the use of the LMM environment to develop Lsd model programs.
- A few documents describe how to use Lsd. See the Documentation entry in the menu Help of LMM.
- The distributed Lsd models produce automatically their own documentation.

MS Windows users
Contrary to Linux and Mac systems, MS Windows systems normally do not contain C++ programming tools (compiler, libraries, debugger, etc.). The Windows distribution of Lsd contains a selection of the MinGW package with all (and only) the packages required to use Lsd, so that no extra software must be installed to use Lsd on such systems.

***********************
MS Windows Installation
***********************
The installation consists simply in unpacking the Lsd files that are structured in a root directory (e.g. C:\Lsd) and several subdirectories for the models, manuals and source code. 

*** IMPORTANT ***
Lsd cannot be installed within a directory (or having an ancestor directory) containing a space in its name. For example, the directory:
C:\Documents and Settings\Lsd
cannot work. If you installed the system in such a wrong directory, simply move the whole Lsd directory in another location.
*******************
When the installation is completed run the file:

- run.bat

in the installation directory. This will run LMM (Lsd Model Manager) that allows to create new models, or select existing models.


*****************
Unix Installation
*****************
To use the Lsd system it is necessary to have a GNU GCC compiler with the standard libraries and the Tcl/Tk package; you likely have already Tcl/Tk installed on your system, but you also need the "development" package for your Tcl/Tk version. Use your preferred package manager to get the 'dev' package.

Though not striclty necessary, it is also suggested to have the GDB debugger (for low-level inspection of a simulation working) and the gnuplot graphical package. 

To unpack the file, e.g. Lsd52unix.tgz,  use the command:
# tar xzf Lsd52unix.tgz
This will create the whole directory structure. 

(if the file is in format .zip, then simple unzip it)

To compile LMM move in the new Lsd directory and use the makefile "makefile.ln":
# make -f makefile.ln

If the compilation succeeds run LMM with:

# ./lmm

If the compilation fails the most likely reason is the mis-specification of the locations of the files required for the compilation. The major problem is that Tcl/Tk may be installed in your systems in several different locations. The makefile contains a list of variables for the directory needed for the Tcl/Tk libraries and include files. For example, on some systems you have the Tcl/Tk library located in /usr/lib, or /usr/local/lib, or usr/share/lib, etc. Similary, the include files may be located in different directories. 
The makefile lists the files you need to identify; check the location for those files and edit the makefile as appropriate for your system. 

It is also possible that Tcl/Tk requires further libraries besides those specified in the makefile. If you have errors even after having specified the correct path to the Tcl/Tk libraries, then find out where the file wish is located (using the command "whereis wish"), and then find out which libraries are used with the command:

# ldd /usr/bin/wish

If the system lists further libraries, add the appropriate option to the linker (e.g. -lieee to add the library libieee.a) in the makefile to the variable DUMMY>

(is anybody willing to write a stupid configure for Lsd?)

!!!!!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!!!!!!!!!
If you modified the makefile to compile LMM, the same changes will need to be made to the makefiles used to generate the Lsd Model Programs. You need to make these changes only once using a command in LMM. Use the menu item System Compilation Options in menu Model. You will have the same variables as in the makefile used to compile LMM that must be set to the same values.


*****************
Mac OS X (Leopard) Installation
*****************
Mac users have two options. Either compile Lsd as a Unix system, or use the package native for Mac OS X. In both cases you need to install the developer toolkit. In the first case you also need to install the X11 package (see the help on your Mac documentation). Then, open a terminal and follow the instructions for installing Lsd on Linux systems.

For a native Mac look&feel you need to install the ActiveState distribution of Tcl/Tk. Unpack the Lsd distribution on your preferred location. Open a terminal and enter the directory of Lsd installation. Give then the command:

> make -f Makefile-OSX

after the compilation launch LMM with the command:

> ./lmm

or simply click on its icon from the Finder.

*******************
Use of LMM and Lsd
******************
LMM (Lsd Model Manager) is a program used to manage Lsd model programs. Lsd (Laboratory for Simulation Development) model programs are stand-alone programs that execute fastly and efficiently difference-equation simulation models. For a user to develop a new simulation model it is only requested to specify the equations of the model in a simplified C++ language, with the assistence of automatic help. Lsd model programs generate automatically the code necessary to link the equations in a coherent sequence within a simulated time steps, saving and elaborating the result, allowing easy access to initialization values, and many other operations required for fully exploiting the simulation model. Both LMM and Lsd offer extensive manual pages for each operation available.

When LMM starts the first operation is to choose a model to work with. Using the LMM's Models' Browser you can either select one of the existing models, or create a new empty one  (that is, no equations, variables etc.). When a model is selected you can ask LMM to:
- compile the model and run it;
- set compilation options
- edit the equations of the model;
- debug the code of the equations with gdb;

Besides this model-specific operations, LMM is also a standard editor for creating and editing text files.

ATTENTION: the very first time a model is compiled an error can be caused by the mispecification of the system directories. In this case, use menu Model/System Compilation Option and use the default values for your operative system to let LMM adjust automatically the error.

When a model program is successfully compiled and run by LMM it can interact with the user with the Lsd interfaces. These permit to control every aspect of the simulation runs (e.g. setting initial values, observing and saving results, reading the model documentation etc.) but for the modification of the code for the equations. For this latter operation you need to close the Lsd model program, tell LMM to show the equation file, edit it and re-compile a new Lsd model program.
