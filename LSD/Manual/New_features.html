<h1>New features in Lsd 5.2</h1>
<br>
The new version maintain the compatibility with all the models built
with previous versions of Lsd. There are several improvements:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Faster code</span>. A new search
function scans the model in a much faster way leap-frogging large sets
of objects. This function avoids the necessity for users to optimize
their code when running large models.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">New interfaces to assign initial
values and number of objects</span>. It is possible to easily
initialize large models with sophisticated data structures.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Change number of objects and
series of data during a simulation run</span>. The initialization
interfaces are accessible also from the data browser window and the
debugger. If marked to be saved in the original objects, elements in
new objects will also be saved,<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Editable graphs</span>. The
labels in the graphs produced in Analysis of Results can now be edited
in their text, fonts and colors, and new labels can be added. Graphs
now include also values at time 0 for parameters and lagged variables.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">New documentation</span>. See
the documentation page from the LMM help.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">New elements' options</span>.
Now the user can specify the variables and parameters more relevant to
be initialized and containing the most relevant results. The list of
these elements can be printed from the Lsd browser and is automatically
inserted in the model report. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stricter error catching</span>.
The number of errors spotted by Lsd model programs is vastly increased.
Moreover, detailed information are provided when an error occurs. For
example, among other things, the system controls the amount of memory
required to save the results, and indicated when it is not sufficient,
leaving to the user the decision on whether to reduce the model
dimension, simulation length, or amount of data to save.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Smoother installation and run
under Linux</span>. A number of problems of compatibility with
different Linux distribution should be solved.</li>
  <li>Other minor bug fixes and documentation improvements.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
