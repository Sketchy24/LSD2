Using a Lsd Model</h1></center>

<h2>
Introduction</h2>
The best way to learn to use a Lsd model is, like any software, to try
and err. In the following is presented a brief tutorial listing the main
steps in using a Lsd model, as guidelines to start using Lsd models.After
this tutorial you should be able to fully exploit an existing model, and
to explore the Lsd interfaces even in the parts not covered here. Refer
to the <a href="TOC.html">main Lsd manual </a>for a complete description
of the Lsd interfaces.
<p>To run a simulation exercise with Lsd it is used:
<ul>
<li>
a <b>Lsd model program</b>. This is a program mixing the C++ code implementing
equations for the model and the general Lsd code to deal with the model.
The modeller has created the code for the equations, and users cannot modify
it by running the model program.</li>

<li>
a <b>model configuration</b>. This is the definition of the model prepared
by the modeller. It contains the description in terms of entities (Objects),
Variables and Parameters. The configuration contains also all the necessary
information used to run a simulation: the number of Objects, the initial
values for Parameters, the number of time steps, etc. Users can easily
modify each of these values to test different configurations.</li>
</ul>
Using Lsd entails the access to several windows, and sometime the one to
use is hidden behind other ones.

Choose the model you want to explore, and then run the corresponding Lsd
model program. LMM automatically starts the Lsd model program for you (ensuring
that it has been properly compiled). The model interfaces are initially
empty, since no configuration is loaded.</td>

Although you may already run a simulation, spend some time to look at how
Lsd represents a model.
<br>The "scheleton" of the model are Objects, elements containing Parameters,
Variables, or other Objects. Therefore, a model is represented by a hierarchy
of Objects, whose "top" element is conventionally called Root. Root is
the only Object that is always present in a model with a single instance,
while the other Objects can be multiplied in as many instances as desired.&nbsp;
<p>It is possible to explore the model with the Browser (square window
on the top left part of the screen), which shows one Object's content.
This is shown with some headers and two list boxes: Variables (and Parameters)
and the Objects contained, if any. Variables are indicated with a integer
number (the lagged values used in the model for that Variable), and Parameters
are indicated with the letter "P". Variables labels can also be double-clicked
to set their options (see below).
<br>The Browser can be moved from one Object to another double-clicking
on the descendants of an Object (to go "down") or on the name of the Object's
"parent" (to go "up").
<br>When a model is loaded a graphical representation of the model is shown
(on the right of the Browser). It is also possible to click on the symbol
of an Object in the graphical representation of the model to move there
with the Browser.
<br>The <b>model help</b> contains the verbal descriptions of the elements,
and the <b>model report</b> the actual code used for the equations and
other relevant information on the model structure. The two documents contain
links to each other bringing at your attention all the relevant information
for each element of the model.</td>

<ul>

</ul>
Run a simulation exercise accepting all the default initialization defined
by the modeller. Before running the symulation, the system issues a confirmation
message listing the options used for the simulation.
<br>A simulation run consist in the Lsd model manager that explores every
Object in the model computing the equation for their Variables. The Lsd
model manager ensures that the values Variables used in the equation of
other Variables are updated as required, independently from the actual
exploration of the model.
<br>During the simulation run some Variables are plotted in a self-scaling
window. More series are saved in the memory for later analysis. During
a simulation it is possible to use the buttons in the Log window:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Stop</b>: abort the simulation</li>

<li>
<b>Fast</b>: make run the simulation faster not issuing any message, if
possible (minimize the Run Time Plot window for accellerating sensibly
the simulation)</li>

<li>
<b>Observe</b>: run the simulation in normal (message issuing) mode, if
requested by the configuration.</li>

<li>
<b>Debug</b>: interrupt the simulation when an equation marked to be debugged
is computed. The simulation run may be resumed after that.</li>

Create graphical representations of the data produced in the simulation.
This module can be used with the data stored in memory after a simulation
run, or using the data previously saved on a file (choose <b>Simulation</b>
for using the data from the latest exercise).
<br>The overall philosophy of this module is to list the elements available
for analysis on the left box. Some of these should be selected and moved
to the central box for elaboration, activated with the button in the lower
part of the window. The right box contains the list of the graphs produced.
<br>Frequently the large number of graphs produced auses a mess to find
one specific graph, or even the main control window. To avoid this, click
on one of the items in the right box to pop the corresponding graph up
in the foreground. Double-clicking any graph brings the main control window
in the foreground.

be loaded.

which can be loaded to continue a simulation exercise.</td>

<ul>

<b>Run/Run</b></li>
</ul>
It is possible that an attempt to run a modified model does not succeed.
The system prevents running model configurations not adapt, issuing messages
to fix the errors. For example:
<ul>
<li>
model already run. The configuration is derived from the last step of a
simulation exercise, and not from a "fresh" configuration file;</li>

<li>
data non initialized. If the number of Objects is increased, then the newly
created instances contain Parameters and lagged Variables that must be
initialized before they can be used for a simulation run.</li>
</ul>
It is also possible some configurations are initialized with non-consistent
values, causing, for example, divisions by zero errors. The simulation
results are, in these cases, erratic, and may even cause sudden crashes
of Lsd. To avoid this keep always a copy of a working configuration, and
try few changes per time.</td>
