<p><b><u><font size="+1">Menu "Data"</font></u></b> <b>All Object Num.</b>
</p>
<p>Lsd represents a model as a hierarchical structure of Objects. With
this routine users can set the number of Objects in each position of
the
model.
<br>
The window shows the number of instances for all Object types in the
model, and allow to change their number.
<br>
The window is organized in lines, where each line corresponds to a
group of Objects of the same type descending from the same instance.
The
lowest part of the window contains, besides the button to return to the
main Browser (activated also by the key <b><font
 face="Courier New,Courier">Escape</font></b>),
an entry to set the maximum hierarchical level of the model shown.
</p>
<center>
<p><img src="numobj.jpg" align="right" height="434" width="508"></p>
</center>
Each line contains:
<ul>
  <li>
the label of the group of Objects. The sign(s) + before the label
indicate
the number of higher levels in the hierarchy than the group of Objects.
For example, the third and fourth line shows that the Objects of type <font
 face="Courier New,Courier">Agent</font>
are placed in the third level (in their branch of the hierarchy the
first
level is <font face="Courier New,Courier">Demand</font> andsecond is <font
 face="Courier New,Courier">Group</font>).
The label is typed in red, and can be clicked as a shortcut for the
initialization
of values of all the Objects of that type.</li>
  <li>
the indication of the exact instance the group is descending from. Each
instance in a group of Object of the same type is indexed. In the
example
above the fourth line is referred to the Objects of type <font
 face="Courier New,Courier">Agent</font>
contained in the second <font face="Courier New,Courier">Group</font>
of
the first <font face="Courier New,Courier">Demand</font>.</li>
  <li>
the number of instances for that group. For example, the fourth line
says
that there are 5 Agent in the second Group of the first Demand.
Clicking
on this number it is possible either to change the number of instances
of this group only, or of all the groups of the same type.</li>
  <li>
possibly, a warning message indicate that the group of Objects reported
in the line contains more descendants, currently not shown. Clicking on
one of these messages increases the hierarchical level shown in the
window.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
<a name="modifyNumberObj"></a><b><font size="+1">Modifying the Number
of Objetcs</font></b>
<br>
The user can click on any of the numbers indicating a group of Objects
to modify it. Depending on the position in the hierarchy of the group
of
Objects it is possible to choose to modify the sets of groups of the
objects
within one "branch" of the hierarchy. For example clicking on the
number
90 indicating the number of Objects "Agent" contained in the second
Object
Group, in turn contained in the first Object Demand, one obtains the
following
window:
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <img src="numobjInput.jpg" align="left" height="281" hspace="30"
 width="265">The
top of the window indicates the label of the Objects that we are going
to modify (<b>Agent</b>, in the example), and the container Object (<b>Group</b>),
along the code identifying the exact copy of the Object. In the example
it is the first Object <b>Group</b> in the second <b>Demand</b>
Object
(hence the <b>2-1</b>).</li>
  <li>
The first entry of this window asks for the desired number of Objects
for
the group concerned, by default the existing number (75 in the example).</li>
  <li>
The third position contains an entry (along the text "<b>Copy from
instance:</b>")
indicating the copy to use as blueprint when new Objects are created.
By
default this entry contains 1, indicating that the first copy of Object
Agent found in the model must be used to add new Objects. That is, the
initial values for Parameters and lagged Variables, and the number of
descending
Objects, if present, will be copied identical to the initialization of
the 1 copy of Agent in the model. Users can insert any ordinal number
referring
to an instance to use as example.</li>
  <li>
The button <b>Compute</b> allows to determine the ordinal number of a
specific
instance of the Object to use as example by determining the ordinal
number
of the ancestors.</li>
  <li>
The list of options <b>Groups to be modified</b> allows the user to
determine
which groups must be modified. By default, only the group of Objects on
which the user clicked is selected to be modified. The user can select
any combination of the available possibilities. For example, selecting
only <b>All groups of 'Agent' in the model</b> will change all the
three
goups of Agent. Selecting the first and the last option, the model will
change all groups in the model contained in the first Object Group.
That
is, both Objects Demand will contain the first Group with the new
number
of Agent's. In general, the topmost selection determines the branch of
the model to be affected by the change. The other options, if selected,
determine the conditions for a sub-branch of the model to be affected.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
If the new number of Objects is lower than before the system has
to remove some copies of the Objects. If the user chose one option that
affected a whole branch of the model than the system automatically
remove
the last copies in each affected group. Instead, if the user chose the
first option, to affect only one group, then the system allow the user
to either remove the last instances or to pick individually each copy
to
remove.
</p>
<p><a name="pick_remove"></a><b>Choose Individual Copies to Remove</b>
<br>
If the user reduces the number of Objects in only one group (that is,
does not affect a whole branch of the model), then the user has the
option
to remove all excess Objects, or choose the ones to remove
individually.
<br>
<img src="pick_remove.jpg" align="absbottom" height="135" width="172"><br>
This window indicates the number of instances to remove. In the
example,
the user indicated 73 Agent, and, since there were 75, it is necessary
to remove 2 copies. Choosing <b>Last</b> the system will automatically
remove all the necessary copies from the last part of the affected
group.
Instead, choosing <b>Choose</b>, the system allows the individual
selection
of the copies to remove. In this latter case, a selection window allows
to insert the series of the Objects to remove.
<br>
<img src="choose_remove.jpg" height="160" width="172"><br>
In this window the user needs to type in and press Return (or click
on Ok), for each element to remove. In the example, the first element
to
remove is the third. Pressing Return the same window will request the
next
and last element to remove. Notice that it is possible to indicate only
increasing elements to remove. In the example, after having indicated 3
for the first remove, the user can indicate only a number from 4 to 75.

<p><b><i><font face="Arial, helvetica">Important</font></i></b>
<br>
When new Objects are inserted in a model they may include initial
values
relevant to start the simulation (lagged Variables or Parameters). For
newly inserted Objects these values are copied by default as defined in
the very initial instance of the Object. But Lsd does not allow a
simulation
to be started unless these values are explicitly set by the user.
Therefore,
after a session where new Object instances are added to the model it is
necessary to edit the Object to set their initial values (see <a
 href="mdatainit.html">Initial
Values</a> in <a href="menudata.html">menu Data</a>). Users can access
to the window for initializing values by just clicking on their label.
</p>
<p><a name="this"></a><b>Menu Data - Set current type of Object</b>
<br>
This option allows to set the number of instances for an Object type
without being forced to represent the whole tree of the model. Here you
set quickly the number of instances of the Object currently pointed by
the Browser to a chosen value. If there are more than one groups of
this
Object type (that is, there are many instances of its ancestor), all
the
groups will be changed so that they will have all the same number of
instances
as specified. If the new value is larger than the existing number of
instances,
the new instances will be appended in the end of the previous set of
instances.
If the new value is lower than the previous number of instances, the
last
ones will be eliminated. To edit the number of instances
differentiating
for each groups of descendants, or to choose the particular instances
to
delete, it is necessary to use the entry "<a href="#top">All Object Num.</a>"
in <a href="menudata.html">menu Data</a>.

<p>In some cases it is necessary to specify an exact instance, or copy,
of an object. Lsd requires the sequential number of the instance among
all the ones present in the model, but in general users find easier to
indicate them in respect of the position in the hierarchy of Objects.
For example, the window above indicates that the 7th object "Worker"
contained in the 2nd object "Department" contained in the 3rd "Firm" in
the second "Market" is the 167th.<br>
Users can set the values in all the cells referring to the objects.
Pressing <span style="font-weight: bold;">Compute</span> will compute
the number of instance requested. Pressing <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Exit</span> will close this window
returning to the calling interface. The computed number will be pasted
in the cell where the instance number is requested.<br>
