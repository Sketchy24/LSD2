<p>Once a model is loaded, its structure is shown with a graphical representation,
as in the figure below:
<br>&nbsp;
<p><br>
<center>
<p><img SRC="Image51.gif" height=408 width=578></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>The graphical representation (which can be incomplete for very large
models) provides a sketch of the basic structure of the model and can be
used to quickly browse through the model, since the symbols can be clicked.
The up-most Object Root is not shown in the window (because normally it
shouldn't contain any element), which begins showing the Objects of the
model from the descendants of Root. Each Object is represented by its label
and by a circle connected with a line to its parent Object. Below each
Object symbol are reported the number of instances currently contained
in the model for that Object. In case there are multiple instances of its
parent Object, there is one number for each group of descendants from each
instance of the parent Object (if there are very many groups, the system
shows only the initial ones).
<p>Moving the mouse pointer over an Object symbol a window will show the
content of the Object, in terms of Parameters (labels followed by <b><font face="Arial, helvetica">(P)</font></b>)
and Variables (labels followed by <b><font face="Arial, helvetica">(n)</font></b>,
where <b><font face="Arial, helvetica">n</font></b> is the maximum number
of lags, see <b><font face="Arial, helvetica"><a href="Browser.html#variables">Variables</a></font></b>).
<p>The window can also be used move quickly the browser to show the content
of one Object type, by double-clicking on its symbol.
<br>The window offers also another shortcut: clicking on one Object symbol
with the right button of the mouse the system will show the initial values
for that Objects (equivalent to the entry <a href="mdatainit.html">Initial
Values</a> in Menu Data when the main Browser is showing that Object type).
