<h1>Lsd Documentation</h1>
<br>
Learning the use of a computer lanaguage is always a difficult task,
and the best way is always to practice with exercises and studying
existing examples. Lsd is no exception. The following documentation is
thought for users without any prior knowledge of programming. <br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Slides of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Lsd course</span>.
As a first piece of documentation read the slides for a <a
 href="Lsd_course.html">course on Lsd</a>. <br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lsd Manual</span>. This document
is a long paper describing how to build a model and listing all the Lsd
functions. It should be handy to have it printed while coding models.
This document may be slightly outdated. The on-line Help pages are the
correct ones in case of differences. Open the <a href="Manual.pdf">Lsd
Manual</a>.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Examples</span>. The
distribution includes several example models. A relatively simple model
containing most of the functions available in Lsd is the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Social Diffusion</span> model, located in
the group <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example Models/Literature</span>.
Understanding the code for the equations of this model will allow to
implement almost any equation you have in mind.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lsd Help pages</span>. Each Lsd
and LMM windows is endowed with a corresponding help page describing
its use. The help pages be browsed to have a quick look at what Lsd can
do. The initial point can be the <a href="TOC.html">table of contents</a>
of the Lsd Browser.</li>
</ul>
