<br><b><font size=+2>Log Window</font></b></center>

<p>This window is a note pad where the system writes down <a href="#Messages">messages</a>
(that users can edit, copy and paste somewhere else). Moreover, during
a simulation run the Log window is active, allowing users <a href="#buttons">to
control</a> the simulation flow.

<br>If the model configuration does not specify a Variable to be plotted
in a <a href="Runtime.html">Run Time Plot</a>, then the Log window will
write down a single line for each time step terminated (see the example
above for the top half window). The lines specify also the number of the
simulation exercises to execute, starting from 0, in case multiple simulation
asks have been requested (see <a href="menurun.html#simsetting">Simulation
Settings</a>). These messages can be suppressed and reinstated with the
buttons <b>Fast</b> and <b>Observe</b> respectively.
<br>Users can ask further information reported in the Log window, concerning
the state of the <a href="debug.html#stackinfo">stack</a>, that is the
single Variable's computations (see the middle of the example window above).
This gives information on each single equation computed, the time, and
whether is was a normal updating or the computation requested by another
equation.
<br>Other messages concern the descriptive statistics produced during a
<a href="mdatares.html">Analysis of Result</a> session (see the last line
in the example above).
<br>In general, any error issues a message with details in the Log window.

<p><a NAME="buttons"></a><b><font face="Arial, helvetica"><font size=+1>Simulation
Control Buttons</font></font></b>
<br>While a simulation is running, users can press one of the buttons in
the lowest bar of the window to modify the simulation flow.
<p><b><font face="Arial, helvetica">Stop</font></b>
<br>Quit the simulation. Simulation data for the&nbsp; result analysis
are saved up to the last step fully computed. In case users decided to
run multiple simulation exercises the remaining simulation runs are not
executed.
<p><b><font face="Arial, helvetica">Fast</font></b>
<br>Increase the speed of simulation preventing the system from writing
messages. In fact, for simple models (with few Variables) spend most of
simulation time just writing down the step number computed.
<br>To further increase the simulation speed, minimize (but not destroy!)
the <a href="Runtime.html">Run Time Plot</a> window, if exists.
<p><b><font face="Arial, helvetica">Observe</font></b>
<br>Return the system to print the messages on the status of the simulation
in case <b>Fast</b> has been previously used.
<p><b><font face="Arial, helvetica">Debug</font></b>
<br>Change the simulation in Debug Mode. This means that when a <a href="Browser.html#variables">Variable
set to be debugged</a> finishes its equation the system interrupts the
simulation and start the <a href="debug.html">Debugger</a>, allowing a
through check of the status of the model. The button has no effect if no
Variable is checked to be debugged.
