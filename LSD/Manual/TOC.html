<a name="introduction"></a><b>Introduction</b>
<br>
Lsd (Laboratory for Simulation Development) is a simple and powerful
language for simulation models. Lsd has been conceived and developed in
order to provide automatically all the technical elements required to
run
a simulation program, although enjoying the maximum freedom to
implement
whatever computational model, since at its core is just pure C++
(meaning
speed, reliability, portability etc.).
</p>
<p>A Lsd model is composed by its computational content, the equations,
and by the model structure. A developing environment (Lsd Model
Manager,
LMM) permits to write with extreme simplicity the equations of the
model,
expressed like difference equations and implemented either in C++ or in
an equivalent simplified macro-language. Using LMM the equations are
compiled
and embedded in a stand-alone program, together with the rest of the
code
for Lsd.. The resulting Lsd model program allows to define the model
and
run the simulations, complete with graphical interfaces for any
possible
operation on the model, from defining the initial values to plot the
final
results.
</p>
<p>Modellers and users of Lsd models need to concentrate exclusively on
the model neglecting every technical aspect of programming (not related
to the actual model). For example, a simple entry in LMM creates a new
model, and another compiles the equations, checks for errors and runs
the
Lsd program. Lsd models are endowed with controls catching errors
whenever
they occur, providing information on how to fix them before they crash
the program.
</p>
<p>Users of an existing Lsd model can load a pre-packaged configuration
of the model (e.g. initial values, number of steps) and repeat the
simulation
as suggested by the model author. New configurations are created with
extremely
simple and intuitive interfaces, so that even users ignoring totally
any
programming language can make use of simulation models.
</p>
<p>Lsd is particularly suited to implement agent-based models, given
its
embedded multi-layered system. However, at the very core Lsd is nothing
else that pure C++ (inheriting its speed, reliability and portability),
with an added a layer of graphical interfaces, so that any
computational
structure can be implemented in Lsd. A model is composed by chunks of
C++
representing the equations of the model (normally very simple).
Modellers
define the entities of the model and the initial data using simple and
intuitive graphical interfaces. At run time the system automatically
arranges
the pieces of code in the correct sequence and collects the results.
</p>
<p>A crucial characteristic of a Lsd model is that it is inherently
modular.
You can (an should) implement one piece per time, test it, and then
extend
the model with a new part. Since the equation are represented like
difference
equations, the system automatically sorts out the correct sequence of
computations
during a simulation time step, signalling possible inconsistencies. The
system provides automatically all the documentation concerning the
model
(e.g. which equation uses which parameter), so that even very complex
models
can easily be reviewed without getting lost in a lot of messy code.
</p>
<p>Lsd appeals to novel programmers because facilitates a gradual,
trial
and error process to modelling, signalling errors and suggesting
solutions.
However, Lsd is also useful for expert programmers because the language
does not pose any limitation to the models it can implement and
facilitates
the management of very complex models.
</p>
<p>An exenstive documentation covers every aspect of Lsd, with
tutorials,
explanations of the interfaces, hints on programming.

<a name="why"></a><b>Why Lsd?</b>
<br>
A Lsd model is simple to write, to use and it is as powerful as any
pure C++ program. Lsd differentiates between the model computational
content
and its numerical values. The former is a subject for modellers, which
are requested a minimum of computer programming. The latter can be
accessed
and modified by any users, given the interfaces and the documentation
functions
provided automatically with a Lsd model.
<p>The main advantage of Lsd is that it minimises the code modellers
are
requested to write for a model. When the model is ready, users of the
model
have available a huge set of interfaces for dealing with the model
(e.g.
running simulations, changing initial data, observing the results,
etc.).
These interfaces are added without any intervention from the modeller,
and permit the thorough exploitation of a model even to users with
scarce
computer experience.
</p>
<p>A very important aspect of Lsd is that it provides a complete
documentation
of a model. This is important for the modeller, since he can easily
control
the effect of a modification even in large and complex models. But this
is even more important for users of a model, since the documentation
provides
a complete and informative way to understand the very functioning of a
model.
</p>
<p>Although Lsd offers several tools to facilitate the writing of
simulation
models, it does not limit at all the scope of models that it can
implement.
In fact, all Lsd does is to wrap C++ code with "smart" interfaces, and
therefore expert users can include in a Lsd model whatever C++ code
they
like. This implies that a Lsd model is extremely fast to run, and it is
virtually unlimited in the dimensions of the model.
</p>
<p>The cost of using C++ is that it generally requires quite advanced
tools
and programming experience. Using Lsd and the programming environment
LMM
modellers create models writing only the code for the equations of the
model, while the technical operations for actually producing the
program
are hidden behind &#8220;smart&#8221; graphical interfaces.
<br>
A non secondary feature of Lsd is that it favours gradual programming,
limiting the scope for errors. The typical cycle to build a Lsd model
is
the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
create a model with one single Variable and all parameters</li>
  <li>
write one equation for the Variable</li>
  <li>
test the model result (and fix the errors)</li>
  <li>
transform one Parameter in a Variable (or add a new Variable)</li>
  <li>
write the equation code for the new Variable</li>
  <li>
go to 3.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
In Lsd this is possible because it is extremely easy to modify a
model adding extra elements (or removing existing ones), and editing
its
code. Moreover, the interfaces provide many powerful ways to explore
the
functioning of the model (e.g. step by step running, conditional
breaks,
modification of values during the simulation etc.).

<p><a name="install"></a><b>Installation and Content</b>
<br>
The installation includes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
the Lsd source code</li>
  <li>
several Lsd example models</li>
  <li>
LMM</li>
  <li>
the manuals for Lsd and LMM</li>
  <li>
other required software (Windows installation only)</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
<i><u>Windows installation (95/98/NT/2000)</u></i>
<br>
Run the self-installing file and follow the instructions. A new item
will appear in your main menu Start to launch LMM or a manual page. Lsd
does not require any additional package to be used under Windows.
</p>
<p><i><u>Unix installation</u></i>
<br>
Lsd requires a GNU C++ compiler and the Tcl/Tk package ver.8.2, all
of which is available for any system under the GNU General Public
License.
These packages are usually available in the standard installation of
almost
every Unix system.
<br>
To install the Lsd system copy the tar-zipped file in a directory and
run the two following commands:
</p>
<p><tt>&gt; gzip -d lsdsc31.tgz</tt>
<br>
<tt>&gt; tar xf lsdsc31.tar</tt>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This creates a directory called LsdSc and
several
subdirectories descending from the one in which you have copied your
distribution
file. Move in the newly created directory and compile LMM with the
commands:
</p>
<p><tt>&gt; cd LsdSc</tt>
<br>
<tt>&gt; ./comp.bat</tt>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will create the lmm executable for
LMM,
to be launched with the command:
</p>
<p><tt>&gt; ./lmm</tt>
</p>
<p>In case of errors due to misplaced or mispelling of the Tcl/Tk
libraries
edit the comp.bat file.
