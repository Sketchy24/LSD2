<p><b><font size=+1><u>Menu "Data"</u> - </font>Data Browse</b>
<p>Since the main Lsd Browser shows the model by means of Object types
it does not distinguish among individual instances of each Object. The
windows to initialize the model (both initial values of variables and number
of entities) are rather heavy, and are inconvenient to use be on huge models
(with, say, more than few dozens of instances for some Object type). In
some cases, modellers may be interested in observing each individual instance
even in huge models. The Data Browser allows to explore the model by visiting
each individual instance of Object in the model and edit individually the
initial data there contained. Its main windows is as follows:

<p>The window is derived from the window used for debugging purposes during
a simulation run (without the functionalities to deal with the simulation
run). See the <a href="debug.html">manual on Lsd Debugge</a>r for information
on the functionalities of the Data Browser.
