</center>
<p>This entry allows to determine the initial values to be used during
the initial time step of the simulation. These values are inserted for
a single Object type, and for all its instances. To set the initial
number
of instance of Objects see <a href="mdataobjn.html">Object Number</a>
in
<a href="menudata.html">menu
Data</a>(or click on the label of the Object in the above window in the
upper left corner).
<br>
The data required to be initalized are the Parameters and the Variables
used with lagged values (to be used in the early time steps of the
simulation),
therefore Variables used with no lags do not appear in the initial data
window. Users can set only the initial values for Parameters and lagged
Variables concerning the Object type shown in the Browser when this
menu
entry is invoked (see the <a href="Browser.html">Browser</a> help page
to move through the model). Variables that are used with one, two, or
more
lagged values will appear once for each lag, because it is necessary to
have initial values for each of the lags.
</p>
<p>The window is formatted as a spreadsheet: each line refers to one
type
of initial value (Parameter or one Variable lag) and each column refers
to one instance of the Object containing that element. For example, in
the window above it is highlighted the initial value for Parameter <b>ms</b>
contained in an Object of type <b>Seller</b>. The exact Object
instance
to which the Parameters and Variables refer to is indicated with an <a href="#lsdcode">automatic
code</a> (2-2 in the example) referred to on the columns' headers. In
the
following it is indicated how to identify the Object instance to which
each cell refers to and the different ways to insert data.
</p>
<h3><a name="lsdcode"></a>Lsd Automatic Coding</h3>
In Lsd, Objects are assigned a unique label and can be replicated in as
many instances as desired.&nbsp; Therefore, there will be many replica
of Objects with the same label (and containing instances of Parameters
and Variables with identical labels). This creates the problem of
referring
to one particular instance when this is necessary, typically for
inserting
initial values and for analysing the results. Since the any instance is
virtually equal to every other instance of the same type, the only way
to differentiate them is their relative position in the model.
<br>
A model in Lsd is structured as a hierarchy: on top is placed Object
<b>Root</b>,
which usually is left empty. Root can contain sets of descending
Objects,
which in turn may contain Objects, and so on. The automatic code
assigns
an integer number to an Object for each "ancestor". For example,
consider
a model with Objects <b>Market</b>, containing Objects <b>Supply
</b>and
<b>Demand</b>,
the first of which contains <b>Producer</b>. The code identifying an
instance
of Object <b>Producer</b> will contain three groups of numbers: the
first
refers to <b>Market</b>, the second to <b>Supply</b>, and the last to
<b>Producer</b>.
<br>
&nbsp;
<h3><a name="insert_manual"></a><b>Inserting data manually</b></h3>
Users can insert values manually by moving through the cells (by
default
the system moves horizontally when the key <b>Return</b> is pressed).
The
window shown above is limited to show 100 instances. If the model
contains
more instances for some type of Objects, the it is necessary to use the
<a href="#setall">Set
All</a> button, located in the beginning of the lines. Users can also
initialize
data using the interface showing one single Object instance (see <a href="menudatabrow.html">Data
Browse</a> in menu <b><font face="Arial, helvetica">Data</font></b>
for
doing this in the general case).
<br>

<h3><a name="setall"></a><b>SET ALL : Inserting data automatically</b></h3>

</center>
A simulation model needs initial values to start a simulation run.
Initial values must be assigned to Parameters and lagged Variables,
that is Variables used with a lag. In this latter case the user must
assign an initial&nbsp; value to be uses in the first steps of the
simulation. A
given element to initialize (Parameter or lagged Variable) must be
given one numerical value for each copy contained in the model, that
is, for each copy of the Object containig the element.<br>
<br>
Users can insert initial value one-by-one with a suitable interface
(see <a href="file:///C:/Lsd5.5/Manual/menudatabrow.html">Data
Browse</a> in menu <a href="menudata.html">Data</a>). However, in most
cases there are many copies of the element to initialize, and the
initialization follows a specific function. For example, the user may
want all the initial values in the 1000 copies of a Parameter set to
the same value. In this cases, Lsd offers the "Set All" functionality,
which allows to set all elements specifying an initialization function.<br>
<br>
The user needs to specify the following options:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Initialization function</span>
to use for the initialization. For example, identical values for all
the elements (option <span style="font-weight: bold;">Equal to</span>)<br>
  </li>
  <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">data values</span> used in
the initialization funtion. Depending on the function chosen these
values can vary. In the example of <span style="font-weight: bold;">Equal
to</span> the value is the number to assign to all the elements.</li>
  <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">frequency</span> of the
initialization. Considering the series of all elements to initialize
(from the first Object to the last), the user can choose to apply the
initialization function to every element or to "jump" regularly some
elements.</li>
  <li>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">extention </span>of the
initialization. The user can choose to apply the initialization funtion
to all elements in the model, or only to a sub-group, specifying the
first and last element part of the group.</li>
</ul>
<center>
</center>
Below you find the detailed description of the available options.<br>

</center>
<h2>Initialization function</h2>
<p>- <b><font face="Arial, helvetica">Equal To</font></b>: the
inserted
Value is assigned to every instance the element in the model;<br>
</p>
<p>- <span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">Range</span>:
the data values used concern the Minimum and Maximum. The system counts
the number of elements to initialize, then assigns increasing values so
that the very first element is set to Minimum, the last one to Maximum,
and the intermediate values to equally increasing values. For example,
if the model contains 100 elements, Miminum=1 and Maximum=100, then the
sequence of elements will be set to: 1 2 3 4 ...<br>
</p>
<p>- <b><font face="Arial, helvetica">Increasing</font></b>: the
values
of the elements are set to increasing values beginning from <b>Start </b>and
adding <span style="font-weight: bold;">Step</span> to each element.
For example, if Start=12 and Step=0.5, then the elements will be
initialized with the following values: 12 12.5 13 13.5 etc.<br>
</p>
<p>- <b><font face="Arial, helvetica">Increasing (Groups)</font></b>:
the
same as Increasing, but the sequence of initial values is re-set to the
Start value when a group of continguous objects is finfished and
another group begins. For example, consider a model made of an Object
Market containing a set of objects Firm. Suppose the model contains
many Market's, and therefore many groups of objects Firm's.
Initializing a parameter in Firm with Increasing (Group), setting
Start=1 and Step=1, the initial values for the Firm's in the first
Market will be set to 1 2 3 etc.&nbsp; When the initialization function
reaches the first object Firm contained in the second Market, the
sequence begins with 1 2 3 again.<br>
</p>
<p>- <b><font face="Arial, helvetica">Random (Uniform)</font></b>: a
random
value is assigned to element to initialize. The random numbers are
drawn from a
uniform distribution whose minimum value is the first value (<b>Min</b>)
and the maximum is the second value (<b>Max)</b>.
</p>
<p>- <b><font face="Arial, helvetica">Random Integer (Uniform)</font></b>:
a random integer value is assigned to element t initialize. The random
integer
values are drawn from a uniform distribution whose minimum value is the
first value (<b>Min</b>) and the maximum is the second value (<b>Max)</b>.
</p>
<p>- <b><font face="Arial, helvetica">Random (Normal)</font></b>: a
random integer value is assigned to element t initialize. The random
values are drawn from a normal distribution whose mean
is
the first value (<b>Mean</b>) and the standard deviation is the second
(<b>Std Dev</b>)
</p>
<p>- <b><font face="Arial, helvetica">File</font></b>: insert data
from
a file. The file must be a text file formed by a single column
containing
an initial label. The label is ignored and the file must contain as
many
lines as instances of the Objects to be initialize.
</p>
<center>
</center>
<h2>Random generator settings</h2><h2><small style="font-weight: normal;"><small>When
using one of the random initialization functions the user can specify a
specific seed, in order to be able to replicate exactly the same random
initialization if needed. Such setting does not affect the random
values during a simulation run, unless the initialization is performed
during a run.</small></small><br></h2><h2>Numerical data for initialization<br>
</h2>
<p>These two entries allow users to insert the parameters for the
initialization function chosen, The labels of the entries vary
depending on the function chosen.<br>
</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Frequency<br>
</h2>
<p>The initialization functions are applied to the sequence of elements
as they appear in the model. By default the function is used for every
element encountered. The user can also choose to apply the function
skipping a specified number of objects. For example, if one sets to
apply the function every 2 objects, then the function will set the
first element, skip the second, set the third an so on. In case of the
box for "Fill in" is checked, the "Increasing" initialization function
will fill also the intermediate elements with the latest values. For
example, suppose to initialize an element with the "Increasing"
initialization function, setting Start = 1 and Step=1. If you have the
frequency every 2 objects and Fill in not checked, then you will get
the series 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 etc. (supposing the element was set to 0 for
all objects). If, with the same function and setting, you put Fill in
checked, then you will get the series 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 etc.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
</p>
<h2>Extension of initialization</h2>
The "Apply to every object" option applies the initialization function
to the whole sets of elements in the model, that is over all the
objects containing the element. Alternatively, the user can choose to
apply the initialization only to a restricted set of object. The group
of objects on which to apply the initialization must be indicated with
the ordinal number of the first and last object on which to apply the
initialization. For example, suppose the model contains 10 objects
Market each containing 20 objects Firm. In order to initialize a
Parameter in Firm, limiting to the copies of Firm in the second Market,
the user needs to insert From=21 and To=40.&nbsp; Clicking on the
entries with the right button of the mouse the user can insert the
ordinal number of the objects by indicating the ordinal numbers of
parent's. See <a href="mdataobjn.html#SelectionInstance">here </a>for
details on this last option.<br>
<h2>Update description<br>
</h2>
<p>This option checked on causes the system to add a verbal description
of the initialization to the description of the element. This
description will appear in the description of the element in the
browser and in the model report.<br>
