<br><b><font size=+2>Components of a Lsd Model</font></b></center>

<p>A model in Lsd is composed by a hierarchical collection of <a href="#obj">Objects</a>,
each defined as containing <a href="#variables">Variable(s)</a> and/or
<a href="#parameters">Parameter(s)</a>
and/or <a href="#objstr">other Object(s)</a>. This information about a
model is spread in several components of a model.
<p>Though a Lsd model is rather intuitive, it is crucial to understand
the difference between the content of the model in terms of structure (i.e.
definitions of the entities) and of data (number of elements and their
initial values). The structure of the model is defined by the modeller
(see <a href="menumodel.html">Menu Model</a>) and cannot be changed (in
general) without changing also the equations of the model, which requires
the technical tools and a (minimal) expertise as programmers. Instead,
once a model is built, the data of a model can be modified by any user,
being guided by user-friendly interfaces (see <a href="menudata.html">Menu
Data</a>) and the model can be simulated (see <a href="menurun.html">Menu
Run</a>).
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="obj"></a><b><font face="Arial, helvetica"><font size=+1>Object</font></font></b>
<p>It is the basic entity of a Lsd model. It represents an entity of the
reality simulated in the model. It is composed by: <a href="#objlab">Label</a>;
<a href="#flagcomp">Flag
for Computation</a>; <a href="#variables">Variables</a>;
<a href="#parameters">Parameters</a>;
<a href="#objstr">Ancestor
and Descendants</a>.
<p>An Object is defined when the model is built and its definition cannot
change during a simulation run. A specific configuration of a model can
implement as many copies, or instances, of a specific Object type, and
this number can also vary during a simulation run. Each instance of an
Object replicates exactly the same structure of any other instance of the
same Object type, but, of course, assigns a specific area of memory for
the numerical values it contains (i.e. Variables, Parameters). The descendants,
as well, must be the same for each instance of an Object, though their
number (i.e. the number of instances of descendants) can vary.
<p><a NAME="objlab"></a><b><i><font face="Arial, helvetica">Label</font></i></b>
<p>Name used to identify an Object type. The label must be unique for each
Object type. The label is a string of any length, but cannot contain end-of-string
characters, like spaces (" "), slashes ("/" and "\") and the like. In Lsd,
labels are case sensitive.
<p><a NAME="flagcomp"></a><b><i><font face="Arial, helvetica">Flag for
Computations</font></i></b>
<p>Normally, this option can be ignored, since it is useful only to increase
the speed of the simulation under certain circumstances. For huge models,
it can be the case that some Objects are used only for storing data. If
there are very many instances of these Objects it is possible to force
the simulation to ignore them during the simulation time step, so that
they are not (uselessly) explored for updating Variables. It is safe to
leave the default option.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="variables"></a><b><font face="Arial, helvetica"><font size=+1>Variables</font></font></b>
<p>It is one type of Lsd element used to store numerical values obtained
as result of an equation. An equation normally uses values of Parameters
and Variables contained in the model, the latter also as lagged values.
<p>Since Lsd is based on the Object Oriented paradigm, it is not possible
to use vectors of Variables. In order to use many instances of Variables
(or Parameters) it is necessary to define many instances of the Objects
containing the Variable or Parameter of interest. Note that this means
that the whole content of the Object will be replicated in many instances.
If a modeller finds out that replicating part of the Object is useless
for the meaning the model, this may indicate that the model structure is
inadequate, and the model needs to be revised, for example creating two
Object in place of the previous one.
<p>A Variable is defined by: label; lags; equation
<p><a NAME="varlab"></a><b><i><font face="Arial, helvetica">Label</font></i></b>
<p>The label must be unique (i.e. no other Variables or Parameters in the
model must share the same label) and can be any length, without using string-terminating
characters. In Lsd, labels are case sensitive.
<p><a NAME="lags"></a><b><i><font face="Arial, helvetica">Lags</font></i></b>
<p>Each Variable is assigned a numerical value at each time step. In most
cases, some Variables need to use the past value(s) of other Variables.
Therefore, the Variables that are used with past values must store these
values computed in previous time steps. These values are referred to as
lagged values, and, when creating a Variable, modellers have to declare
how many lags the Variable will have to store. In case of erroneous declarations
it is not possible to add new lags to an existent Variable, but is necessary
to <a href="menumodel.html">delete the Variable and create a new one</a>
with the correct number of lags (and the same Label).
<p>If a Variable is defined as having no lagged values, it does not need
to have any value at the beginning of the simulation, since its values
are always computed at each time step. But, in case it has lagged values,
users need to assign numerical values that will be used during the earliest
time step of the simulation as lagged values. See how to <a href="mdatainit.html">set
initial values</a>.
<p><a NAME="equations"></a><b><i><font face="Arial, helvetica">Equations</font></i></b>
<p>The values for Variables are computed at each time step using a piece
of C++ code. The code of all the equations for the Variables in a model
is contained in a C++ source file, which must be compiled and linked to
the rest of Lsd source code in order to obtain a Lsd simulation model.
<p>The code for a Lsd equation can be any legal C++ piece of code. The
value of the Variable for the generic time step is the one assigned to
the C++ variable "res". Note that the equations can also perform other
functions, besides providing numerical values. For example, they can create
or destroy Objects, sort sets of Objects, overwrite previously computed
values of Variables or modify values of Parameters. Since it is pure C++
code, an equation can also be used to activate external packages.
<p>The code for an equation must be interpreted as the computations to
be executed during a generic time step. During the simulation runs, the
Lsd system takes care of updating the different Variables so that to respect
precedence order implied by the lag notation used in the equations' code.
That is, if an equation is like X<sub>t</sub>=f(Y<sub>t</sub>), the system
will automatically compute the equation for Y before the equation for X,
because the Y's updated value is necessary for X. If, instead, the equation
is like X<sub>t</sub>=f(Y<sub>t-1</sub>), then the system may compute X
before Y, because the Variable Y had store its value of the previous time
step. Using the Lsd functions to overwrite existing value must be used
with extreme care because it destroys this automatic updating order control.
See the <a href="lsdfunc.html">Lsd functions</a> for further details.
<p><a NAME="parameters"></a><b><font face="Arial, helvetica"><font size=+1>Parameters</font></font></b>
<p>A Parameter is an element of Objects that is assigned a numerical value
and is not changed by the system during the simulation time step. Therefore,
it is basically a Variable without equation (and no lags, of course) with
attached a numerical value.
<p>In order to run a simulation, it is necessary that each Parameter (i.e.
each Parameter contained in each instance of Objects) is assigned a numerical
value before a simulation is run. See how to <a href="mdatainit.html">set
initial values</a>.
<p>Though the system does not computes explicitly new values for Parameters
during a simulation run, the equations for Variables can overwrite the
value of a Parameter during the execution of their code.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="objstr"></a><b><font face="Arial, helvetica"><font size=+1>Ancestor
and Descendants</font></font></b>
<p>A model in Lsd can be considered as a collection of Objects organized
in a <a href="graphrep.html">hierarchical structure</a>. That is, each
Object has one and only one ancestor (from which it descends) and, possibly,
a set of descendant Objects. The structure of the model must be determined
on the basis of the meaning of the Objects. In general, an Object is defined
as a descendant of another Object if it can interpreted as a component
of its parent Object. Technically, a the hierarchy is used by Lsd at run
time to allow the equations for Variable in an Object to easily find values
contained in Objects replicated in many instances. For example, consider
a model that contains many instances of Object Market, from each of which
descend many Objct Firm. If equations for variables in Firm needs to retrive
values contained in Market, each Firm
<br>One two Object are defined as one descending from the other, any instance
of the parent Object is will contain at least one instance for each of
the Object types descending from it.
<p>In Lsd, the structure of the model is used in order to retrieve Variables
and Parameters during the simulation runs. In the equation code, modellers
refer to other Variables or Parameters of the model by simply using their
labels. But, of course, in general there can be many instances of the Variables
or Parameters, one for each instance of the Object defined as containing
that element. In order to choose which instance to use, Lsd exploits the
hierarchical structure:
<ul>
<li>
a value in the model must be requested to one specific Object.</li>

<li>
If this Object contains the requested element, this one is returned.</li>

<li>
If it does not contain the requested element, the Object sends the request
to its descending Object, if there are any.</li>

<li>
In case also this search fails, the request is sent to its parent Object,
which will use the same strategy (of course, the search strategy is implemented
in such a way to not pass twice through the same Object).</li>
</ul>
This search strategy has the property that, if the model is well defined,
modellers can write the equations' code by simply using the label of the
Parameter or Variable necessary, despite the number of instances they can
replicated in the model. For example, consider a model where an Object
Market is defined as having one Parameter Price and several instances of
descendant Object type Firm. If the model data define Market as being replicated
in several instances, each of them will be defined as having a group of
descending Object Firm. If the equations in Firm request the value of Price,
each of them will refer to the instance of Price contained in their own
instance of parent Object Market, so that the modeller does not have to
worry for specifying which Price to use among the many present in the model.
<p>Lsd provides also ways to overrule the default mode. Suppose that, for
an extension of the above cited model, the modeller wants Firm's to choose
the Market on which they operate. Therefore, Firm will not be any longer
a "component" of Market, but each time Price is used in the equations an
algorithm to decide which Market to refer to will be used. In this case,
the model structure can be changed to have groups of Firm defined as "parallel"
to groups of Markets.

<p><a NAME="Models' Technical Representation"></a><b><font face="Arial, helvetica"><font size=+1>Models'
Technical Representation</font></font></b>
<p>The information about a Lsd is spread in two distinct parts: the equations'
code and the model structure and data. The equations are expressed as C++
code that the model writer has compiled and linked to the rest of the system.
The model structure and its data are instead loaded dynamically.&nbsp;
In this way, the simulation program resulting is as fast as a pure C++
program, though it is extremely flexible because every value of the model
can be easily changed. On the other hand, in order to change even slightly
the equations of a model, it is necessary to recompile the whole system
( see the <a href="LMM_help.html">LMM manual </a>on how to accomplish this).
<p>The information on the structure of the model and on the initial values
used for the simulations is contained in text based files (by default with
the extension "lsd"). <a href="nw82_lsd.html">See one of these files</a>.
They contain:
<ul>
<li>
the structure of the model (name of the Objects and their content);</li>

<li>
the initial values (number of instances of Objects, values for Parameters,
values for lagged Variables);</li>

<li>
some technical information (e.g. variables to be saved or debugged);</li>

<li>
simulation settings (number of time steps and the like);</li>

<li>
the name of the equation file (for presentation purposes only)</li>
</ul>
These files should never be edited manually, since they are created and
used automatically by the system, and if the file has some unexpected content
the results are impredictable. In case, it is possible to change the order
of the content of the elements in the first part of the file, since this
affect the order of presentation of the elements in the Browser. The order
in which elements appear does not have any relevance for the simulation,
but may improve the readibility of a model.
<p>When Lsd loads one of these files, it creates in the memory the structure
of the model corresponding to the configuration contained in the Lsd model
file currently loaded. The memory structure of the model triggers the creation
of all the graphical interfaces, so that they result as if were built specifically
for that model. When running the simulation of the model each variable
of the model is connected to the piece of code corresponding to its equation
stored in the executable. In other words, each Lsd model is a program that
contains the code of the equations for a given set of Variables. It can
load any model respecting the Lsd standards, but can run only a model that
contains only the Variables for which the program has the equations' code.
Note that the equations' code embedded in a Lsd simulation model can also
concern Variables not contained in a model, because this code will simply
be never used. But it is not possible to run a simulation model with a
Variable whose code was not considered when the Lsd simulation model was
compiled.
<p>This system allows, for any Lsd simulation program containing any set
of equations (even no equations at all) to load and edit the structure
of a model. Only when the simulation is actually launched, the possible
inconsistency among labels of the variables in the model and labels of
the equations in the program can cause the system to issue an error.
