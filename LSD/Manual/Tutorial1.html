<center><b><font size=+2>Tutorial 1 - First use of LMM and test runs of
available models</font></b></center>

<p>This tutorial guides the first-time users to open LMM, explore its components
and test the models available in the installation. The only way to learn
using a software is to try it. Therefore, users are invited to test and
explore any aspect of the windows appearing while following the tutorial.
This software comes with an extensive manual (see here for a <a href="TOC.html">list
of the main pages</a>), covering every window of the programs in the package,
and discussing many issues concerning Lsd simulation modelling.
<br>The following text explains the steps required for an early exploration
of the system. There are many links to other manual pages. Use the icon
bar in your screen to use the links, observe the Lsd/LMM windows, and return
to this page.
<br>To install and run the system read the&nbsp; <a href="LMM_help.html#install" TARGET="newindow">installation
instructions in the LMM manual</a>. At start time choose the "Create a
new Text File" option.

<td>Observe LMM
<br>Interface</td>

<td>LMM is made of a text editor with several menus containing mostly standard
editing commands. However, the menu <b>Model</b> is special. It allows
to select a Lsd model and, when this is done, its commands refer to that
model. For example, the command <b>Model/Show Equations</b> automatically
inspect which is the source file containing the equations of the model
selected and loads it into the LMM editor.
<br>The menu <b>Edit</b> includes many commands useful for writing C++
code, particularly on international keyboards (e.g. insert the ever present
'{' and '}', missing in French keyboards, by menu entry or by keyboard
shortcut).
<br>Note that most of the items in the <b>Model</b> menu are not active,
since no model is selected yet. See <a href="LMM_help.html" TARGET="newindow">the
manual for information</a> on the LMM interfaces.
<br>The menu <b>Help</b> offers the manual pages most likely to be useful
to Lsd programmers.</td>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td>Select a model</td>

<td>Open menu <b>Model/Select Model</b>. LMM will list all models available.
Scrolling the list a brief description of the model highlighted is shown.
When a model is selected, LMM loads a brief description of the model content.
<p>A <a href="FAQs.html#model">Lsd model</a> is a combination of C++ compiled
code (implementing the equations) and a Lsd specific data structure to
implement the model elements. Using LMM a modeller can access the C++ file
containing the code for the equations (i.e. how Variable X must compute
its values), and modify it. LMM permits also to modify the compilation
options, and generally performing every operation necessary to compile
a Lsd model program.&nbsp;
<p>When a model is loaded in LMM the editor shows initially the same description
seen in the list of models. Moreover, the commands in menu <b>Model</b>
become active, and will refer to the specific model selected (the header
line of LMM reports the model information). Users can use this menu to
access the most relevant model files.
<br>See the <a href="LMM_help.html#model" TARGET="newindow">LMM help page</a>
for more information on menu <b>Model</b>.</td>

<td>Run the Lsd model
<br>model program</td>

<td>Create a Lsd model program using the command <b>Model/Run</b>. The
system automatically compiles all the Lsd source files and the model specific
equation files. If no errors are found, LMM links and run the Lsd model
program for the model selected. Failures to compile may be due either to
Lsd system configuration (e.g. wrong libraries) or to errors in the model's
code. See the <a href="LMM_help.html#run">manual page on this command</a>.&nbsp;
<p>The very first time this command is issued may take few minutes, since
it compiles all the Lsd source files. Future requests to compile any Lsd
model program will use the same pre-compiled Lsd source files, having only
to re-fresh the model specific code (the model' equations).
<br>A Lsd model program is an independent program (you may run it even
outside LMM) containing the equations code that tell the simulation how
to compute each Variable at each time step. Any Lsd model program has the
same appearance, which are the interfaces used to load model configurations,
to change the initialization, to run and control a simulation, and to manage
the results. However, each model differ in the equations it contains.
<br>The main interface is the window <b>Browser</b> which issue commands
before and after a simulation (during a simulation it is not active). The
menus in this window contains all the commands to control every aspect
of a simulation simulation (see the <a href="Browser.html" TARGET="newindow">help
page </a>on this).
<br>The window <b>Log </b>contains messages and is used to control a simulation
run (e.g. interrupt or abort a simulation). Several other windows are created
depending on the actions requested to the Lsd model program (see the <a href="windows.html" TARGET="newindow">help
page</a> listing the Lsd windows)</td>

<td>Run a test simulation</td>

<td>Using the newly appeared interface for the Lsd model program choose
the command <b>File/Load</b>, choose one of the configuration file(s).
After that, choose menu <b>Run/Run</b> to run a simulation. The simulation
will either show a graphical representation of the series produced, or
will print messages in the <b>Log </b>window. The data produced during
a simulation are stored in memory so that to analyse them after a simulation
(or during the interruption of a simulation run). These operations will
be seen in the second tutorial.
<p>After the simulation close the Lsd model program (menu <b>File/Quit</b>).
See help on the <a href="Browser.html">Lsd main Browser</a>, or the <a href="TOC.html">general
help page on Lsd</a> for further details.</td>

a Lsd model program before running another one. They can actually run in
parallel, but this would overcrow your screen.</td>
