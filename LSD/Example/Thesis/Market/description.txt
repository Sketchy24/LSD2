Market Evolution
(Very complex model)

This model, developed by Marco Valente, represents the evolution of a whole market
from the earliest beginning onwards. It is a sort of test to whether the 
computational representation of very complex phenomena can be of some help
to identify the causes of some real world events.
The model does not aim at replicate any specific real world case, but
only provide an environment to test hypothesis.

The model considers the following processes:
- entry of new buyers, who shape their preferences depending on the state of 
the system at the time of their entry;
- entry of new producers offering an innovative product (the entry rate is exogenous, while the new producers' characteristics are set to an average value over the best product);
- learning for buyers, a function of the time spent using of the innovative 
product, and affecting the capacity to correctly judge alternative products 
in future purchases;
- bounded rational choice algorithm for buyers, meaning that buyers apply 
a choice function minimizing the information to elaborate to reach 
a "satisfycing" solution;
- revision of preferences for buyers, a function of the modified conditions of 
the market, of the marketing from producers and experience of the 
buyers, affecting future purchases;
- innovation for producers, who develop improvements on their products following 
a R&D strategy endogenously determined to have the largest competing advantages. 
The R&D efforts provide results that are subject to the technological 
experience cumulated in the past by the firm and the technological constraints 
posed by a set of exogenous technological complementarities.
- revision of the marketing strategy for producers, who modify the marketing 
goals depending on the changing competitive conditions on the market and 
their technological level relative to their competitors.
