nw2004 - Revisiting the Nelson-Winter model of industrial dynamics

Esben Sloth Andersen, esa@business.auc.dk
Version: 23 Jan 2004

This file contains the Lsd macro code for exploring the Nelson-Winter
model of Schumpeterian competition (Nelson and Winter, 1982, ch. 12).
It builds on programs of Murat Yildizoglu (version: 21 Oct 2001), Marco
Valente, and Toke Reichstein (version: 27 Jan 2003).

Statistics-level parameters

   Regime_restraint - Monopolistic behaviour in the industry
              0: no monopolistic behaviour
              1: monopolistic restraint due to mark-up pricing

              0: no fission of large firms
              1: fission of large firms
   Fiss       - Determines the probability of fission, since
                fiss * ms is lambda in a Poisson distribution
                that determines whether fission takes place
Firm-level parameters
   RIM - Imitative R&D per unit of capital
   RIN - Innovative R&D per unit of capital
