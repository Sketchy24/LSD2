HISTORY OF THE NW2004 PROGRAM

23 March 2004: nw2004 version 0.6. Changes to adapt to Andersen's
course on Schumpeterian economics at Kyoto University

22 January 2004: The NW2004 model (version 0.5)
- After many Lsd model variants, Esben Sloth Andersen made a major
change in the older Lsd versions of NW. The changes have two major
purposes: (1) to allow moving from simpler to more complex versions
of NW-like models, (2) to allow the use of new features like new
firms that spinn-off from old ones, and (3) to include a powerful
analytical tool for analysing the simulation results

28 January 2003: A modification of the NW standard
- A revised version by Toke Reichstein. Is not distributed with Lsd5.1 
but available from the Lsd Model Download Site

21 Oct 2001: A revised NW standard
A revised standard NW version by Yildizoglu, distributed with Lsd4.1
and Lsd5.1

5 May 1999: The first NW model for Lsd
- Lsd version of NelWin 82 by Yildizoglu, derived from the first
Lsd version by Valente 

1995-1999: Prehistory as NelWin models in Maple
- At Aalborg University both Andersen and several economics students
reconstructed and developed Maple implementations of many, partly
rather complex, versions of different Nelson-Winter
models. Documentation of one type of work is found in Andersen, E. S.,
Jensen, A. K., Madsen, L., and Jørgensen, M. (1996), "The Nelson and
Winter Models Revisited: Prototypes for Computer-Based Reconstruction
of Schumpeterian Competition", DRUID Working Papers:
