These models include all the Lsd functions. Understanding these models should allow users to implement any kind of equation.

There are four versions of the model. The first two versions implement the model as described in the original paper. The computational version provides a much better understanding of the results as compared to the analytical solutions proposed in the paper.

The further two versions extend the model to include entry and exit, and a possible role of marketing. Such extensions are proposed as example of how a model should be implemented, starting from a robust version and testing more complicated extensions. They are also an excuse to show how to use advanced Lsd features, like the desctrution and creation of objects.
