- Changed the InitAgent variable in a parameter

- Set the parameters AgentType to the IdClass where you want to collect statistics. I used only one class with IdClass=1

- set the parameter NumBlocks in Agent to 10

- set the RewardType to the desired type of mutation

- Set MaxBitLength in Agent to the number of bits you want in each Block. I set 3.

- Set the number of objects BitBlock to 3 for each block

- Set the parameters IdBitBlock to increasing (group) values. In the end each bitblock will have 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1 ... values for this parameter

- Set the number of objects Agent to 35. This will replicate the agent as you initialize it, including the number of blocks, bitblocks etc.

- Assigned to the parameter IdAgent increasing values from 1 to 35

- Set parameter NumClass in Class to 35, indicating that there are 35 agents

- set N in Landscape equal to 30, since we defined 10 blocks with 3 bits each.
