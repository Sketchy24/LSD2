Prey and Predator Model
(Intermdiate complexity. Old equation grammar)

The model represents two populations of a prey and a predator, Sheep and Wolfs.
Sheep enjoy higher reproduction rates, but suffer both from hunting and from limited food. Wolfs depend for the food on the availability of sheep, otherwise they die just by age.
